# Lottery-Application

Created my first blockchain based decentralized application.
The application does a lottery campaign and takes ether and then a function decides a winner.
I also created a very basic react frontend to interact with smart contract. 
I also write the test with mocha to try my smart contract. Then compiled and deployed it using web3.js and truffle-hdwallet provider. 
The deployment is on the fake network provided by the metamask wallet called Rinkeby network. 

Inside the LOTTERY folder you will find the smart contract + deploy.js + compile.js
Inside LOTTERY-REACT you will see the interface
